# ImaginaryNumberGame


Welcome to the Imaginary Math Game! This interactive Python program generates random complex numbers, squares them, and asks the user to perform the square operation.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script (`complex_math_game.py`).
2. You will be prompted with a question in the form of (a + bj)^2, where 'a' and 'b' are random integers.
3. Enter the real and imaginary parts of the result when prompted.
4. Repeat for a set number of questions.
5. Your score will be displayed at the end.

## Example Question
